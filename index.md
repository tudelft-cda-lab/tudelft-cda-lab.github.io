 # Cyber Analytics Lab
---

Welcome to the Cyber Analytics lab at Delft University of Technology. We perform research in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science for 
Cyber Security and Software Engineering. Our main aim is to get knowledge from software data and use that for analysis, anomaly detection, 
and classification/intrusion detection. That is why our focus is on developing learning algorithms for white-box models that can be understood 
by developers and security analysts, such as decision trees and state machines (or deterministic Markov models). Futhermore, 
we make them learn from streaming data and robust against evasion. Key topics we study are: State Machine Learning, Automated Reverse Engineering, 
Network Traffic Analytics, Attacker Behaviour Modelling, Attack Graph Modeling, Declarative/Optimal Machine Learning, Fuzzing/Symbolic Execution, and Adversarial Machine 
Learning.
